_SupaC: A fork of HolyC implementation of Terry A. Davis's HolyC_

```hc
void Main()
{
  "Hello world\n";
}
Main;
```

Full documentation for the language and this compiler can be found here:

# Introduction 
SupaC is a custom-built compiler for the SupaC language, written entirely in C. It currently compiles directly from the abstract syntax tree (AST) to raw x86_64 assembly, which is then assembled using GCC. While it doesn‚Äôt yet perform optimizations, it fully supports floating-point arithmetic and most core language features. Additionally, there's experimental support for transpiling SupaC to standard C, opening the door for broader compatibility and further development.

## Example
Below is a snippet of code showing some of the features supported by this holyc
compiler. Namely inheritance, loops, `printf` by using a string and loops. All
c-like control flows are supported by the compiler.

```hc
class SomethingWithAnAge
{
  I64 age;
};

class Person : SomethingWithAnAge
{
  U8 name[1<<5];
};

void ExampleFunction(U0)
{
  Person *p = MAlloc(sizeof(Person));

  MemCpy(p->name,"Bob",3);
  p->age = 0;

  while (p->age < 42) {
    p->age++;
  }
  "name: %s, age: %d\n",p->name,p->age;
  Free(p);
}

ExampleFunction;
```

# Compatibility üñ•Ô∏è‚öôÔ∏è
- The SupaC compiler currently targets x86_64 architectures, generating assembly code that is assembled using GCC. It has been successfully tested on AMD-based Linux systems and Intel-based macOS, ensuring reliable execution across these platforms.

- Since SupaC directly compiles to standard x86_64 assembly, it should be compatible with most modern x86_64 processors, including those running Windows (via WSL or MinGW), various Linux distributions, and even BSD-based systems with appropriate toolchains. While ARM and other architectures are not yet supported, future updates may introduce cross-compilation capabilities to expand its reach. üöÄ

## Using the Compiler  

Once the SupaC compiler has been compiled, it can be used to compile <code>.HC```files. Additional options and features can be displayed by running:  

<code>supac --help```

## Key Differences Between SupaC and TempleOS HolyC  

SupaC introduces several improvements and modern features over TempleOS HolyC:  

- **<code>auto```Keyword for Type Inference**  
  - Allows automatic type deduction, making code easier to write and read.  

- **Range-Based For Loops**  
  - Can be used with:  
    - Static arrays  
    - Structs containing an <code>entries```field and a corresponding <code>size```field  
  - Example:  
    <code>for (auto it : myArray) { /* Do something */ }``` 

- **Flexible Type Casting**  
  - Supports both <code>cast<type>```and postfix type casting:  
    <code>auto num = cast<int>(3.14);  // Explicit casting using cast<T>``` 
    <code>float f = 10;``` 
    <code>int i = f<int>;  // Postfix type casting``` 

- **Support for <code>break```and <code>continue```in Loops**  
  - Unlike HolyC, SupaC allows <code>break```and <code>continue```statements in loops for better control flow.  

- **C Library Integration (<code>libc</code>)**  
  - Any standard C library function can be used by declaring its prototype with <code>extern "C"</code>:  
    <code>extern "C" int printf(const char*, ...);``` 
    <code>printf("Hello from SupaC!\n");``` 
  - This enables compatibility with existing C codebases.

## Control Flow Graph Example  

### Example Code:  
```c
int Main()
{
  auto i = 1;

  for (I64 j = 0; j < 10; ++j) {
    "%d",j;
  }
  while (i) {
    printf("hello");
  }

  return 1;
}
```

### Compilation Command:  
<code>supac -cfg ./&lt;file&gt;.HC && dot -Tpng ./&lt;file&gt;.dot -o &lt;file&gt;.png``` 

This produces a control flow graph for the compiled code. To generate visual outputs using <code>-cfg-png```or <code>-cfg-svg</code>, ensure you have [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) installed.

## Experimental Transpiler  

The SupaC transpiler can be invoked with:  
<code>supac -transpile &lt;file&gt;.HC``` 

It attempts to convert SupaC code into standard C, including inline assembly. However, it does not preserve comments, and some <code>if```conditions may require explicit brackets to function correctly.  

### Example:  

#### Input SupaC Code  
```c
asm {

U0 Main()

  U8 *number = "12345";
  auto num = ToInt(number);
  "%ld\n",num;
